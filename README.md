# Word Recall Challenge (for elderly)

## Overview

This is a simple and engaging Python-based word memorization game designed to help users, especially the mild cognitive elderly, practice and improve their word recall abilities. It's also a fun challenge for anyone looking to sharpen their memory in an interactive way. The game presents a set of words, hides one, and then prompts the player to identify the missing word, offering helpful hints along the way.

## Features

*   **Word Memorization Challenge:** Players are shown a list of words and then challenged to remember a missing one.
*   **Progressive Hints:**
    *   On the **second attempt**, descriptive clues related to the missing word are provided (e.g., "It is machine, contains a screen, and is cold").
    *   For subsequent **incorrect alphabetic guesses**, partial word hints are revealed, showing correctly guessed letters in their positions (e.g., `la____` if 'l' and 'a' were correctly guessed for 'laptop').
*   **Multiple Attempts:** Players are given a set number of attempts (default: 3) to guess the word.
*   **Input Validation:** The game ensures that user input consists only of alphabetic characters and automatically converts it to lowercase for fair comparison.
*   **Clear Interface:** Utilizes terminal clearing and countdowns for a focused and engaging user experience.
*   **Supportive Feedback:** Provides encouraging messages and reveals the correct answer if the player runs out of attempts.

## How to Play

1.  **Start the Game:** Run the Python script.
2.  **Memorize Words:** A list of words will be displayed. Take a moment to memorize them.
3.  **Countdown:** A 5-second countdown will begin.
4.  **Identify the Missing Word:** After the countdown, the screen will clear, and one word from the original list will be replaced with underscores. Your task is to guess this missing word.
5.  **Enter Your Guess:** Type your guess and press Enter.
6.  **Hints:**
    *   If you're on your second attempt, you'll receive a descriptive hint about the word.
    *   If your guess is incorrect but contains some correct letters in the right places, you'll see a partial hint (e.g., `_a_p_o_`).
7.  **Continue Guessing:** You have a total of 3 attempts.
8.  **Outcome:**
    *   If you guess correctly, you'll be congratulated!
    *   If you run out of attempts, the correct answer will be revealed.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.x
*   `pandas` library (used in the provided code, though not strictly necessary for the core game logic shown, it's good practice to include if the full project might use it).

## Installation

1.  **Save the Code:** Save the provided Python code as a `.py` file (e.g., `word_recall_challenge.py`).
2.  **Install Dependencies:** Open your terminal or command prompt and install `pandas` if you don't have it:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```

## Running the Game

Navigate to the directory where you saved the `word_recall_challenge.py` file in your terminal or command prompt, then run:

```bash
python word_recall_challenge.py
